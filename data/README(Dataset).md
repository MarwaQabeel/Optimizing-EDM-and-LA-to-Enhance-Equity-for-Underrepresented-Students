ABSTRACT = {Higher education institutions record a significant amount of data about their students, representing a considerable potential to generate information, knowledge, and monitoring. Both school dropout and educational failure in higher education are an obstacle to economic growth, employment, competitiveness, and productivity, directly impacting the lives of students and their families, higher education institutions, and society as a whole. The dataset described here results from the aggregation of information from different disjointed data sources and includes demographic, socioeconomic, macroeconomic, and academic data on enrollment and academic performance at the end of the first and second semesters. The dataset is used to build machine learning models for predicting academic performance and dropout, which is part of a Learning Analytic tool developed at the Polytechnic Institute of Portalegre that provides information to the tutoring team with an estimate of the risk of dropout and failure. The dataset is useful for researchers who want to conduct comparative studies on student academic performance and also for training in the machine learning area.},
