Optimizing Educational Data Mining and Learning Analytics to Enhance Equity for Underrepresented Students


Educational Data Mining (EDM) and Learning Analytics (LA) enhance student
outcomes but may perpetuate biases against underrepresented groups. This project
introduces a fairness-aware framework employing adversarial debiasing and fairness
constraints on datasets with demographic, academic, and socioeconomic data. Statistical
evaluations and interpretability tools like SHAP and LIME assess performance and
fairness. Results show reduced demographic parity differences with maintained high
accuracy, fostering equitable resource allocation and educational equity.
